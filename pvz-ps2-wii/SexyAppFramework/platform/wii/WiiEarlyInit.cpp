// WiiEarlyInit.cpp — runs before main(), and before the rest of static init.
//
// Why this file exists
// --------------------
// The game reads resources from *static initializers*, before main() is ever
// entered: SharedConstants::acceptableLetters and
// ChatAllowedCharacters::allowedCharacters are global constants whose
// initialisers call Resource::getResource("/font.txt").
//
// That is harmless on PS2, where assets are baked into the ELF and a resource
// lookup is a memory read. On the Wii the assets live on an SD card or a USB
// drive, so the lookup needs libfat mounted -- and mounting it in main() is far
// too late.
// The failure mode is nasty and gives no clue what happened:
//
//     static init -> getResource -> ifstream fails (nothing mounted)
//                 -> throw -> exception escapes a static initialiser
//                 -> std::terminate -> abort, all before any video init
//
// which on hardware and in Dolphin is a black window and a hang, with no output
// anywhere.
//
// SD or USB
// ----------
// Neither is a build-time choice and neither is preferred by construction. One
// call to fatInitDefault() mounts every device libfat knows about, and the
// install directory is then *resolved* rather than assumed -- see
// collectMountedDevices() and resolveAppDir() below. Everything downstream (assets, worlds, options,
// screenshots, this file's own boot log) hangs off wiiGetAppDir(), so nothing
// else in the port has to know which device it ended up on.
//
// Order here is deliberate: VIDEO AND CONSOLE FIRST, storage second. Storage is
// the thing most likely to fail or stall (no SD inserted, Dolphin without a
// card configured, a slow USB enumeration), and diagnosing that is impossible if
// the screen is not up yet to say so.
//
// Mechanisms, because no single one is sufficient:
//
//   1. A constructor with priority 101 (the lowest GCC allows; 0-100 are
//      reserved). Prioritised constructors run before unprioritised ones, so
//      video and the filesystem are ready before any of the game's own globals
//      are constructed.
//
//   2. wiiEnsureStorage() / wiiEnsureEarlyVideo() are idempotent and are also
//      called defensively from Resource_wii.cpp and File_wii.cpp, so nothing
//      depends on constructor ordering being what we expect across toolchain
//      versions.
//
//   3. A terminate handler. Anything thrown before the renderer exists would
//      otherwise vanish silently; routing it through CrashHandler::Crash puts
//      the message on the TV, which is the only place a user can read it.

// with no path to Arena2 anywhere in it. An earlier note in README_wii.md
// claimed the heap "spills into MEM2 automatically once Arena1 is exhausted",
// and claimed to have verified it by disassembly. That is wrong, and it was the
// reason a failing malloc kept being dismissed as a weak hypothesis on this
// target: with MALLOC_MEM2 at its default of 0 the entire heap was the MEM1
// leftovers -- about 8 MB once the ~14.5 MB ELF, the two framebuffers and the
// GX FIFO are paid for. A world load spends that on a handful of chunk sections
// (the log shows single sections wanting ~190 KB of GX display list) and then
// every allocation fails, including texture loads, which is what put the game on
// its own out-of-memory screen seconds after entering a world.
//
// Arena2 is ~50 MB, so this is roughly a 6x heap. The cost is latency: MEM2 is
// GDDR3 and slower than MEM1's 1T-SRAM, and everything malloc'd moves there --
// including the Tessellator's 2 MB scratch buffer, which is the hottest CPU-side
// buffer in the game. If profiling later says that hurts, the answer is a small
